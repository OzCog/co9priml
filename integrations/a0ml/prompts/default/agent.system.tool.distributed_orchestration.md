### distributed_orchestration

Use this tool to participate in distributed task orchestration.

The distributed orchestration system allows you to:
- Register as an agent with specific skills
- Break down complex goals into manageable subtasks
- Coordinate with other agents on task execution
- Monitor system-wide progress and efficiency

#### Methods

**register_agent** - Register yourself in the distributed system
- `skills` (list): Your capabilities/skills (e.g., ["data_analysis", "reporting", "coding"])

**decompose_goal** - Break down a goal into atomic subtasks
- `goal` (string): The high-level goal to decompose
- `context` (string, optional): Additional context for better decomposition

**assign_tasks** - Request task assignment from available pool
- No parameters required - automatically assigns based on your skills and availability

**get_status** - Get current orchestration system status
- No parameters required

**get_task_tensor** - Get tensor representation of current task state
- No parameters required - returns T_task[n_tasks, n_agents, p_levels]

**mark_completed** - Mark a subtask as completed
- `subtask_uuid` (string): UUID of the completed subtask
- `result` (string): Description of the completion result

**update_heartbeat** - Signal that you're still active
- No parameters required

#### Usage Examples

Register as a data analysis agent:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "distributed_orchestration:register_agent",
  "tool_args": {
    "skills": ["data_analysis", "statistics", "visualization"]
  }
}
```

Decompose a complex goal:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "distributed_orchestration:decompose_goal", 
  "tool_args": {
    "goal": "analyze customer satisfaction trends and create actionable insights",
    "context": "Using Q4 2024 survey data from 10,000 customers"
  }
}
```

Request task assignment:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "distributed_orchestration:assign_tasks",
  "tool_args": {}
}
```

Check system status:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "distributed_orchestration:get_status",
  "tool_args": {}
}
```

Mark a task as completed:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "distributed_orchestration:mark_completed",
  "tool_args": {
    "subtask_uuid": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "result": "Data collection completed successfully. Gathered 10,000 survey responses with 95% completion rate."
  }
}
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Register Early**: Register with accurate skills when starting a distributed workflow
2. **Update Heartbeat**: Regularly update your heartbeat during long-running tasks
3. **Clear Results**: Provide detailed results when marking tasks complete
4. **Check Dependencies**: Use status to understand task dependencies before requesting assignments
5. **Collaborate**: Coordinate with other agents through the orchestration system rather than direct communication

#### Workflow Integration

The orchestration system works best when:
- Multiple agents register with complementary skills
- Goals are decomposed into parallelizable subtasks
- Agents regularly check for new assignments
- Task completion is promptly reported
- System status is monitored for bottlenecks

This enables efficient distributed execution of complex workflows across agent networks.
