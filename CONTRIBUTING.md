## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cogprime.git
   cd cogprime
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Docstrings in Google style

Format your code with:
```bash
black src/
```

Lint your code with:
```bash
pylint src/
```

### Testing

Run tests before submitting:
```bash
python -m pytest src/tests/ -v
```

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. Create a Pull Request

## Code Review Process
